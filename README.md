## Project Overview üè•
CareAI provides a suite of predictive models for various diseases:
- **Skin Cancer Detection**
- **Brain Tumor Classification**
- **Alzheimer‚Äôs Stage Prediction**
- **Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Detection**

Additionally, CareAI includes a healthcare chatbot to assist medical staff with information and preliminary diagnosis.

## Features üöÄ
- **Predictive Models**: Tailored machine learning models for specific diseases and deployed each in an online endpoint in Azure.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Built with React for a seamless user experience.
- **Backend API**: Flask-based backend for model consumption and data processing.
- **Healthcare Chatbot**: AI-powered chatbot for medical staff interaction built using LLama2 and CTransformers
- **Cloud Deployment**: Models deployed on Azure ML Studio for scalability and accessibility.

## Installation üíª
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- Python 3.8 or later (for backend)
- Git

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chebil-Ilef/CareAI.git
   cd CareAI
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd src
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate (on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   flask run
   ```

## Usage üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
1. **Frontend**: Access the React application via `http://localhost:3000`.
2. **Backend**: Ensure the Flask server is running at `http://localhost:5000`.

The application provides an intuitive interface for interacting with predictive models. Users can input data for disease prediction and receive results through the web interface.
